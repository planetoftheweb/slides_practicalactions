Right now, if I go to the link for my repo, since I turned on GitHub Pages, you'll notice that although the readme document appears there, the podcast feed doesn't.

If we go to the repository, you'll note that I've been creating the code for the different videos I've been recording under different branches, but the main branch right now doesn't have any of the updates.

That's because I haven't merged with the main branch.
