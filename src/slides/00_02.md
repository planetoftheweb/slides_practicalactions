You can find all of the slides for this course at raybo.org/slides_practicalactions which is the page you're looking at.

This course is a bit different in that it has three sample repositories associated with it. You can see them right on this page. In the course, I refer to these repositories and create them for different needs, but you can also get to them from this slide.

At the bottom of the screen, there is a toolbar, which you can show or hide by hitting the t key. There are some links to my courses, my blog and some other contact information.

You can hit the M key to see the menu and then pick one of the videos for the course. If you want to watch the slides for the third video in the first chapter, then you'd pick this slideshow from the list.
